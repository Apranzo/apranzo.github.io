","LA BONTE’S TOP 100 ENGLISH CONVERSATION PATTERNS INTRODUCTION When you learn a language, there are three basic skills which have to be learned: conversation, reading and writing. Just because you know how to speak English, doesn't necessarily mean that one knows how to read. There are many Americans who can speak well, but do not know how to read. Even if you can speak and read English, it is difficult for some to write in English. Can you write well enough to write a book or write an article for a newspaper? Writing well is perhaps the most difficult skill to master. You will often hear complaints in companies that they have college graduates that can't compose a simple letter well. The teacher can unwittingly confuse students by teaching them reading and writing skills rather than teaching them conversation skills first. Children naturally learn conversation skills as a child, go to school and begin to learn how to read and finally begin to learn how to write compositions in grammar school. Rarely is that learning order reversed. For the beginning student who wishes to learn English conversation, it is hard to distinguish patterns which are commonly found in conversation as opposed to reading and writing. Many begin to believe that their lack of conversation skills stem from their lack of vocabulary skills. I knew many students who studied English for years, but continued to be frustrated by their utter inability to converse or even hold the simplest of conversations. In this book, I attempt to highlight for the students the most common CONVERSATION PATTERNS that they will constantly hear with great frequency from a native speaker. All vocabulary revolves around these basic patterns. Not only does vocabulary revolve around these patterns, but more importantly most feelings conveyed in conversation are communicated through these patterns. My basic premise is that there are commonly about 150 conversation patterns around which all vocabulary is connected to. In one hour, a native speaker will use at least 90 of these individual patterns, and some of those individual patterns may be used multiple times. Obviously, if the student learns to recognize and utilize these patterns while talking, they will greatly accelerate the development of their conversation skills. How do I know that at least 90 of the 150 or so patterns are used within an hour? Well, I can listen to a conversation and during the hour period I can write down every time a pattern is used. Every time the same pattern is used, I make a mark next to it indicating that it was used more than once. It is not uncommon for some of the same patterns to be used 10 times or more per hour.The beginning student, on the other hand, utilizes only about 5 to 10 of these total 150 patterns within an hour which severely handicaps their ability to convey feelings in conversation. When I teach this system I do NOT concentrate on any new vocabulary learning. Vocabulary can be learned with a good dictionary at the student’s leisure. What the student needs help with is identifying these commonly used conversation patterns and helping them to utilize these basic patterns when they hold a conversation. As unbelievable as it may seem, I usually take between 20 and 25 hours to review these 150 patterns with the student. After that time, most students can hear the pattern when used in conversation, plus more importantly give me a reply using the same pattern. If the student can reply to a question using the same pattern I used in the question, I know that they have been able to hear the pattern and respond with the same pattern conveying the appropriate feeling. I do not read the book with the student. We take one pattern at a time, ask a number of questions with that pattern in the past, present and future tense and then go on to the next pattern. I will make a sentence with the pattern and ask the student to make it into a question. I constantly backtrack reviewing the patterns that we have already learned. I keep vocabulary very, very simple.At all times I know what the student should know since we are constantly reviewing throughout the first 20 hours the patterns that we have previously learned together. Below you will find some samples of what I mean. Teacher question Student response Do you want to study? Yes, I want to study. Do you feel like meet ing her? No, I don't feel like meet ing her. Is it alright to go? Yes, it is alright to go. What does it look like ? It looks like a house. When you study, do you like to drink Coke? Yes, when I study, I like to drink Coke. Did he plan to go? * I don't know if he planned to go. What did he tell you to do? He told me to come back later. The student must answer using the same pattern I used when asking the question. *If they don't know the answer, they have to answer I DON'T KNOW IF sentence . They just can't answer I DON'T KNOW. ","LA BONTE’S TOP 100 ENGLISH CONVERSATION PATTERNS This method of teaching is very progressive beginning with the simplest of patterns. PATTERNS -- I study. 21 I want to study. 21,68 I want to study with him. 21,68,80 I want to study with him for 1 hour. 21,68,80,95 I want to study with him for 1 hour before mom comes home. 21,68,80,95,106,109 I said I want to study with him for 1 hour before mom comes home. When reviewing the patterns I keep in mind that there are a few basic skills that everyone must master: 1. How to make a positive sentence I go. 2. How to make a positive question Do you go? 3. How to make a negative sentence I don't go. 4. How to make a negative question Don't you go? 5. Present tense positive sentence/negative sentence I go. I don't go. positive question/negative question Do you go? Don't you go? Past tense positive sentence/negative sentence I went. I didn't go. positive question/negative question Did you go? Didn't you go? Future tense positive sentence/negative sentence I will go. I won't go. positive question/negative question Will you go? Won't you go? 6. I give the student a sentence and they have to turn it into question. I went. Did you go? The student can practice by themselves using this simple table of exercises with each pattern. PATTERN: I HAVE TO v . PAST PRESENT FUTURE + Q positive question Did you have to go? Does he have to go? Will you have to go? - Q negative question Didn't he have to play? Don't they have to play? Won't they have to play? WWWWWH Q What, where, why, when, who, how question What did you have to do? What do you have to do? What will we have to do? + S positive sentence I had to study. She has to study. They'll have to study. - S negative sentence She didn't have to leave. You don't have to leave. He won't have to leave. So, when reviewing each of the patterns, I mix it up by sometimes asking negative questions in the past tense, positive questions in the future tense, etc. The student must respond with the same tense in either the positive or negative . Nothing else is acceptable. I have found that this system of learning greatly accelerates a student's ability to develop conversation skills. By helping to identify what the beginning students will most often hear from native speakers will help them to quickly develop their conversation skills. Rather than emphasizing vocabulary, eccentric grammar rules or difficult to remember grammar jargon, I instead focus on CONVERSATION PATTERNS through which most feelings are unconsciously conveyed. Special thanks goes to my wonderful wife, Serena, and my children Tina, Donny and Jimmy.

Doesn't she know that? 2. When WHO or WHAT are the subject of the question, DO, DID and WILL are not used. (present) Who studies this? What fits in that? (past) Who ate pizza? What hit you? (future) Who will live there? What will go in here? 3. With WHO, WHAT, WHEN and WHERE, when you imply a plural subject or object in the question, you will often hear ALL added. eg. WHAT ALL, WHEN ALL, WHO ALL, WHERE ALL . Who all did you meet? = Who did you meet? Where all did she study? = Where did she study? What all did you eat there? = What did you eat there? When all did she work? = When did she work? 4. WHOSE n v ? This is a variation of WHO when you want to be specific about an object or person. Whose pen did you lose? Whose sister will come? Whose car did you see? Whose brother do you like? 5. In a question with a verb or adjective, you will sometimes hear AT ALL added to the end of the question. AT ALL has no meaning. When responding, it only sounds okay at the end of the negative sentence. It is not used when questions begin with What, Where, Why, When etc. Did you eat at all ? Is she tired at all ? Does he know it at all ? No, he doesn't know it at all . 6. EXCEPTIONS .......... There are a few exceptions when DO, DID and WILL are not used. EXCEPTIONS SENTENCE QUESTION a. TO BE You are happy.

When plural nouns are found in the object of the sentence or question, you will hear SOME and ANY preceding the plural noun a lot. SOME and ANY have no special meaning, they just sound good when used with the plural noun. SOME often sounds strange in a positive sentence and ANY often sounds strange in a negative sentence SOME ANY +s I bought some food. ------- -s -------- I didn't spend any money. +q Did she eat some dessert? Does he like any girls? -q Won't he write some letters? Doesn't he take any sugar in his coffee? Did you buy some coffee? = Did you buy any coffee?

","LA BONTE’S TOP 100 ENGLISH CONVERSATION PATTERNS 7 QUESTIONS THAT AREN'T QUESTIONS 1. In conversation, it is common to hear questions asked in the sentence form except for questions beginning with WHAT, WHERE, WHY etc. With this form, the inflection in the voice goes up at the end of the sentence. Did you go? = You went? Is she tired? = She's tired? Does he have to study? = He has to study? Will he want to come? = He'll want to come? Are they going to bring it? = They're going to bring it? Have you got to eat? = You've got to eat? SHORT ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 2. In conversation, you will hear short answers to questions. I suggest that students who are beginning to learn conversation complete the full sentence instead of using these short forms. This way it will help the student to become accustomed to the tense of the verbs, and help to develop fluency. With some patterns, just the verb is dropped in the answer. Students will get used to this the more they speak and hear conversation. Positive Answer Negative Answer Did he go? Yes, he did . No, he didn't . Is she tired? Yes, she is .

(wrong...because it is not a sentence after HOW COME.) 2. WHAT q FOR? Use only with verbs in positive questions. Do not use with negative questions or questions with adjectives. There are some adjectives where it sounds all right (eg. famous). However, for some reason with many adjectives it sounds strange, so I suggest that beginning students don't use this with an adjective. What did he come for? = Why did he come? What does she want to bring it for? = Why does he want to bring it? What did they call her for? = Why did they call her? 3. WHY IS IT THAT s ? THAT is optional.

He didn't have money, so I gave him $5. So I gave him $5, he didn't have money. (wrong) Since he didn't have money, I gave him $5. Because he didn't have money, I gave him $5. 4. When answering a question with WHY, the question is repeated in sentence form after SO. Why are you tired? I worked all morning, so I am tired . How come she didn't want to go? She was sick, so she didn't want to go . What did they call for? They wanted to talk to you, so they called . 5. A short form of BECAUSE is CAUSE . I suggest that you use BECAUSE in the beginning. CAUSE is usually used when people are speaking fast. 6. GIVEN THE FACT THAT s and GIVEN s are similar patterns, but not used as much. Given the fact she's always complaining, I'm not going to tell her about it. Given it was late at night, they decided to return home right away. What did he leave early for?

SINCE s IN ORDER TO v BECAUSE s 2. FOR v ING sounds good with some verbs. It is tricky to use. It is difficult to explain when it sounds good or not, so I suggest that students new to conversation use BECAUSE s , SINCE s , TO v and IN ORDER TO v . 3.

Use COULDN'T or WOULDN'T in the negative sentence. They took the beer so we couldn't drink it. He brought us to the library so we wouldn't have to buy the book. c. Use DIDN'T HAVE TO or WOULDN'T HAVE TO in the negative sentence if you want to imply that you did someone a favor. He cleaned the house so his mother didn't have to do it.

If there is a very weak possibility that something can happen, then COULD is used. e.g. Many people want to travel to the United States from foreign countries. If there is no real possibility of this happening, COULD is used. I wish he could go to the United States. If there is a realistic possibility of this happening, WOULD is used.

Instead of the subject coming in the front of the sentence, it is found after the verb followed by BY n/op . With the passive verb, note the change in order of the sentence: ACTIVE: SUBJECT + VERB+ OBJECT PASSIVE: OBJECT + PASSIVE VERB + BY SUBJECT* *In most cases  BY SUBJECT is not used since most people know who you are talking about. They were driven there by John. = They were driven there. 3. The active form is used much more than the passive form. ACTIVE PASSIVE present She eats the apple. The apple is eaten . past They took the food The food was taken . v PP The student has taken the test. The test has been taken . future John will use this book. This book will be used . 4.
